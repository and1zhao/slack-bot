# Slack Bot

Creating a Slack bot with many functions, including reacting with BTTV emotes, filtering out messages with cuss words, etc. More functionality to be added later.

The original goal of this project was to build a Slack app that would notify me with messages from the Whale Alerts API (checking large movements of cryptocurrency), but transitioned into something more as I learned more about the Slack bot functionality.
